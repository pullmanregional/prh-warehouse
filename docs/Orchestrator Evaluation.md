## Requirments

PRH data warehouse requires an orchestration system for scheduling and coordination of ingest and analysis of data from multiple data sources

- Initial should support 8-10 data sources. As analytics needs grow, will likely increase.
- Low operational complexity with long term stability and pricing are important given that system is deployed at a rural regional hospital with limited resources.
- Observability with automated monitoring and alerting are crucial for stability and safety.
- Systems for segregating PHI are important as system will be handling patient-adjacent information.

## Products

### Prefect

Modern workflow management system optimized for data pipelines.

- User-friendly interface and powerful scheduling capabilities
- Python-based approach accessible for data engineers and scientists
- Flexible and easy to use, allowing quick workflow development and deployment
- Advanced UI and monitoring for clear visibility into workflow status
- Balances power and simplicity, reducing "negative engineering"
- Growing ecosystem of integrations
- https://www.prefect.io/, founded in 2018, originated from Jeremiah Lowin's work at Airbnb (Airflow)

Specific advantages for this project:

- Low startup cost, with ability to transition to self-hosting
- Simple workflows, like this warehouse, handled using straightforward components without unnecessary complexity

Disadvantages:

- Server auth and https handled separately

### Airflow

Mature orchestration tool with robust scheduling and extensive integrations.

- Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide clear visual representation of data flows
- Vast ecosystem of integrations and strong community support
- Steep learning curve and complex setup/maintenance
- Basic UI compared to newer alternatives
- Powerful but can be overkill for simpler data warehouse needs
- https://airflow.apache.org/, created at Airbnb in 2014, became an Apache project in 2016

### Temporal.io

Excels in microservices orchestration but can be adapted for data workflows.

- Handles complex, long-running processes with built-in fault tolerance
- Manages stateful workflows effectively
- Excellent scalability for large-scale operations
- Steep learning curve due to microservices focus
- May be overly complex for simpler data warehouse scenarios
- https://temporal.io/, founded in 2019, evolved from Uber's Cadence project

### Dagster

Focuses specifically on data pipelines with a unique asset-based approach.

- "Software-defined assets" concept aligns well with data warehouse management
- Excellent UI for data lineage and pipeline health visibility
- Moderate learning curve, but requires shift in thinking for traditional ETL teams
- Strong focus on data-centric workflows
- Good scalability for most data warehouse needs
- https://dagster.io/, founded in 2018 by Nick Schrock, who previously worked at Facebook

### Inngest

Specializes in event-driven workflows with a low barrier to entry.

- Advantageous for event-triggered data warehouse ingestion
- Low learning curve and multi-language support
- May not be ideal for complex scheduling requirements
- Basic UI and monitoring capabilities
- Cost-effective for small to medium-scale operations
- https://www.inngest.com/, founded in 2021, originated as an independent startup

### Restate.dev

Focuses on building distributed applications with durable execution.

- Manages state and asynchronous processes effectively
- Supports TypeScript, Java, and Kotlin
- Excellent scalability for distributed systems
- May be overkill for simpler data warehouse needs
- Newer platform with potentially limited community support
- https://restate.dev/, founded in 2022, originated as an independent startup

## Recommendation

The choice of orchestration system for a simple data warehouse with a low number of datasources depends on our specific team expertise and resources. Prefect and Dagster are as strong contenders due to their focus on data workflows and balance of features. Prefect's user-friendly approach and advanced monitoring capabilities make it particularly attractive our team with the ability to quickly set up and maintain data pipelines without sacrificing power or flexibility.

Prefect is simplest in terms of ease of use and rapid development. Python-based workflows, combined with a robust UI and growing ecosystem, provide a solid foundation for managing diverse data sources. While Airflow remains an important option given its longstanding track record, it is more suited to teams with existing expertise. Temporal.io or Restate.dev are more appropriate for complex distributed processing needs. Prefect will provide an optimal balance for our data warehouse scenario, considering team resources, scalability requirements, and the complexity of data processing.

## Update August 2025

The orchestration layer was converted from Prefect to GitHub Actions in August 2025.

As of July 2025, Prefect [no longer supports](https://www.prefect.io/blog/introducing-two-new-self-serve-plans-for-prefect-cloud) using your own infrastructure on the hobby/free tier.

On review of the current deployment and automation needs in practice, GitHub Actions was a strong alternative:

- Minimal operational complexity. The scheduler is cloud-based, zero-management, and zero-cost.
- It includes a mature runner that runs on self-hosted infrastructure.
- There is hierarchical monitoring that extends to the task level and can be integrated with visualization tools like Grafana easily. In practice, the hierarchical logs with email alrrts are sufficient.
- It includes robust secret management.
- Due to its environment handling, code structure was considerably simpler than with Prefect.
- No limitations on number of scheduled deployments vs Prefect.
